When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You might wish to use a remote repository when you are a contributor on a project.
Or you're working from a different computer and don't want to clone the entire 
repository onto it yet. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually using git pull let's you choose what branch of the remote repository you want
to pull as well as which branch in the local repository you want it to be added to. 
When you have multiple branches, experimental versions of a project, and multiple 
contributors, the freedom that manual pulling provides will be helpful.
