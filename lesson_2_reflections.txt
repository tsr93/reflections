What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Using git init when you're in a directory initializes it as a git repository.
This makes it so that commits can be made and multiple versions of files in the 
repository can be tracked. It will also allow us to use other git commands such as 
git checkout or git diff as needed. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is intermediate between a working directory and a git repository.
It allows you to choose which files should be included in a particular commit. 
Using git add lets you add files to the staging area. Once all the necessary files
have been chosen they will all be committed in the next commit. This is valuable 
since it offers the choice of not having to commit every single file in the repository
each time you make a commit.
